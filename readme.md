# Github Cloner

## What it does?

This python tool clones all your (own) repositories into a folder with the name of the main language
used in the repository. The language is detected by the github API, which just takes the main
language detected as 'repository language' as far as I know.

Example output:
![example output]("example_output.png")

## Why?

I like having my code checked out locally to browse through when I'm working on something so I can
use it as a reference. I could use the github website, but I like doing it locally.
It might be useful to some others so I'm putting it up here.
